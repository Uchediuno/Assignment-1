    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
       Hello, I'm Uche Ezediuno, a passionate and creative individual with a background in political science. I graduated from the University of Benin.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work as a UI/UX designer, where I create engaging and user-friendly digital experiences.</p>
    <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I am also a photographer and content creator.
I find joy in expressing my creativity and capturing moments that tell unique stories. Every time I work on a project, like making a website look nice or taking a great photo, I see it as a chance to mix creativity with practicality.</p>
<p>I think good design can be both pretty to look at and helpful in solving everyday problems</p>
    <h2>Why I joined Alt School</h2>
    <p>I joined Alt School because I saw it as an opportunity to grow in my career. I discovered that if I wanted to stay relevant in my field I need to upskill and constantly evolve.</p>
    <p>I also joined because I haven't be so sucessful in self paced learning, I needed a community that will push me beond my limits in learning and that has been the cas so far. Im really grateful I made the decision to be a part of this program.</p>
<h3>What I plan to achieve with Alt School</h3>
    <p>I plan to finish the course, get certified, get a well paying job and go on to a more successful journey in my career, and one day be a part of someone else's growth</p>
